# 1) INTRODUCTION
With online platforms facilitating costless comparison of businesses (Santos, 2003, pp. 233-235), star-ratings — a measure of business performance — are increasingly important for profit-maximising firms as they influence public perceptions of firms’ reliability and customers’ subsequent willingness to consume (Jabbour, 2023). Additionally, with 52% of customers being sceptical of star-ratings unaccompanied by reviews (PowerReviews, 2021), customers likely see the review content as an important justification for the star-rating.

Therefore, this research conducts a textual analysis of reviews to predict star-ratings given by consumers to businesses. Unlike conventional sentiment analysis, we postulate that textual analysis is more relevant for businesses as it clearly identifies key attributes that are prioritised by customers in reviews, allowing businesses to make targeted investments and boost their star-ratings to attract customers and maximise profits. 

This report comprises 5 sections: Section 2 explains the Data Science Methodology, Section 3 prepares the data, and Section 4 constructs and evaluates 4 prediction models. Section 5 assesses the chosen model’s deployment, while Section 6 addresses difficulties encountered.

# 2) METHODOLOGY
This research uses John Rollins’ Data Science Methodology (Figure 1) due to it being better able — compared to other methodologies — to incorporate new practices in data science such as the usage of big data and the conducting of textual analysis (Rollins, 2015, p. 2). Additionally, the methodology’s iterative feature allows for constant re-collection and re-processing of data (Rollins, 2015, p. 5), enabling the tuning of models to be more accurate in prediction. Hence, this project will be structured according to the methodology.

As our machine was unable to process the original large dataset, we imported a pre-made smaller dataset _“review_data_small”_ and took a random sample which served as an unbiased representation of the population. We acknowledge that precision may be lost due to fewer observations being captured, but the expensive solution of increasing the machine’s Random-Access Memory was unfeasible given our resource constraints. 

We removed all observations which contained empty reviews as they served no informative function. Furthermore, we removed all observations containing duplicated reviews, preserving only 1 review to avoid potential contradictions where the same input generates different output. 


```{r include=FALSE}
##2.3 Remove duplicates and empty text
review_data_clean <- review_data_small %>%
  filter(!duplicated(text) & text != "")

##2.4 Clear Memory
rm(review_data_small)

randomsample <- sample(1:nrow(review_data_clean), 1*nrow(review_data_clean)/2)
review_data_small2 <- review_data_clean[randomsample,]

#4.1 Clear Memory
rm(randomsample)
rm(review_data_clean)

```


## 3.2) UNDERSTANDING

We treat star-ratings as a continuous variable to account for variance that is lost when treating star-ratings as a categorical variable (Al-Natour and Turetken, 2020, p. 2), thereby enhancing the models’ performances. Additionally, treating star-ratings as continuous enables businesses to better visualise how specific words used in reviews affect predicted star-ratings. 

We clean the text by converting it into lowercase without any digits and punctuation, before tokenising the text and removing stopwords — which are words that provide little information — using the pre-made stopword list _“stopwords-iso”_ due to it being the most comprehensive.

```{r include=FALSE}
#5.0 DATA PREPARATION: Filter the data

##5.1 In review_data_small --> only extract relevant columns (1:review_id // 4:stars // 8:text)
review_data_small3 <- subset(review_data_small2, select = c(1,4,8) )
View(review_data_small3)

##5.2 Clearing Memory
rm(review_data_small2)


#6.0 DATA PREPARATION: clean the text
review_data_small3 <- review_data_small3 |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    clean_text = tolower(text), #converts all text in the 'text' column to lowercase --> eliminate case sensitivity and ensure consistent representation of words
    clean_text = gsub("[']", "", clean_text), #remove all single quote characters (') from the text, ensuring that they don't interfere with subsequent processing
    clean_text = gsub("[[:punct:]]", " ", clean_text), #eliminate all punctuation marks, such as commas, periods, question marks etc, leaving only whitespace-separated words
    clean_text = gsub("[[:space:]]+", " ", clean_text), #replaces multiple consecutive whitespace characters (spaces/tabs/newlines) with single spaces, ensuring consistent spacing between words
    clean_text = gsub("[[:digit:]]", "", clean_text), #removes digits
    clean_text = trimws(clean_text)) #trims any leading or trailing whitespace from the beginning and end of each word, ensuring that words are represented in a consistent manner

##6.1 Remove duplicate rows with duplicates in clean_text (again)
review_data_small3clean <- review_data_small3 %>%
  filter(!duplicated(clean_text) & clean_text != "")

##6.2 Clear memory
rm(review_data_small3)

##6.3 Extract the relevant columns
review_data_small4 <- subset(review_data_small3clean, select = c(1,2,4) ) #extract out column 1 (review_id), column 2 (stars) and column 4 (clean_text)
View(review_data_small4)

##6.4 Clear memory
rm(review_data_small3clean)


#7.0 DATA UNDERSTANDING

##7.1 Install required packages
install.packages("tm")
library(tm)
install.packages("tidytext")
library(tidytext)

##7.2 TOKENIZE THE TEXT
#Consider filtering out redundant words
tokenized_review <- review_data_small4 %>%
  unnest_tokens(input = clean_text, output = word)

View(tokenized_review) #View the tokens

##7.3 Remove stopwords
install.packages("stopwords")
library(stopwords)
cleaned_tokenized_review <- tokenized_review %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords()) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stopwords(source="stopwords-iso")) #remove stopwords, where stopwords are extracted from a pre-made list called "stopwords-iso" 

##7.4 Clear memory
rm(tokenized_review)
```

From the data, we observe that individual words are often associated with multiple star-ratings. Hence, our model will predict star-ratings based on the combined effect of multiple words within a singular review.

```{r include=FALSE}
##7.5 Count and sort most common words
cleaned_tokenized_review %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) 

##7.6 Count the occurrences of words with specific stars, sort based on frequency
overall_stars_text_count <- cleaned_tokenized_review %>%
  count(word, stars, sort = TRUE)

View(overall_stars_text_count)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
##7.7 Visualise
overall_stars_text_count %>%
  filter(n > 0.5*length(cleaned_tokenized_review)) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  slice_max(order_by=n,n=50) %>% #Select the top 50 words 
  ggplot(aes(word, 0.5*length(cleaned_tokenized_review), fill = stars)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Contribution to stars rating")
#Finding: Based on the top 50 words that impact star ratings (ie frequency of word used), we expect these words to be useful indicators of a user's eventual star rating
#--> In terms of tangible business attributes, "food", "service", "staff", friendly", "delicious", "restaurant", "experience" are within the top 50 words that have the largest contribution to star rating (due to their highest usage)
```

## 3.3) PREPARATION
We convert the text into a document feature matrix (DFM) and filter out words that appear in less than 3% of the observations to remove explanatory variables with little data. This DFM is converted into a data frame featuring star-ratings (output) and the frequency of usage for each word (predictors) for a given review. 


```{r include=FALSE}
#8.0 DATA PREPARATION -- Create a Document Feature Matrix (go back to "review_train_small4", but remember to remove stop words here)

##8.1 Install required packages
install.packages("quanteda")
library(quanteda)

##8.2 Create a corpus
corpus_review <- corpus(review_data_small4$clean_text, docnames = review_data_small4$review_id)
summary(corpus_review)

##8.3 Tokenise the text
token_review <- tokens(corpus_review)

##8.4 Create a Document Feature Matrix (this will take a pretty long time)
DFM_review <- dfm(token_review) %>%
  dfm_remove(c(stopwords(source="stopwords-iso"))) #remove stopwords from the premade stopword list "stopwords-iso" 

##8.5 Remove stopwords

##8.6 Trim DFM

##9.1 Convert DFM into a matrix containing only predictors (ie features and words)
Matrix_DFM_review <- as.matrix(Trim_DFM_review) #IT WORKSSSSSSSSS

###9.1.1 Clean Matrix by deleting the column containing the predictor variables "stars" and "star" as these are unlikely to give significant information, and instead complicate things due to them bearing the same/almost similar names as output variable
Matrix_DFM_review2 <- subset(Matrix_DFM_review, select = -c(stars,star))

##9.2 Acquire vector containing output (stars) from original training dataset "review_data_small4"
stars_review <- subset(review_data_small4, select = c(2))

##9.3 Join output with predictors
Matrix_review <- cbind(stars_review,Matrix_DFM_review2)

```{r include=FALSE}
#9.5 Display top 10 rows

```

We split the data into a training dataset and a test dataset in a ratio of 3:1, ensuring that there are at least 10,000 observations in the test dataset to attain more accurate estimates of out-of-sample performance for evaluation. To ensure that models thoroughly learn meaningful patterns, we set the training dataset to be larger than the test dataset. 

```{r include=FALSE} 
#10.0 DATA PREPARATION: SPLIT INTO TRAINING AND TEST
train <- sample(1:nrow(Matrix_review), 3*nrow(Matrix_review)/4) #split 3/4 and 1/4

# 4) MODELLING AND EVALUATION
## 4.1) ORDINARY LEAST-SQUARES (OLS) REGRESSION 
Assuming a linear relationship between the frequency of usage for each word and the star-rating, we seek to minimise the difference between our predicted value and our actual value. Therefore, using the training data, we construct an OLS regression where the predicted star-rating for consumer i is: 

$\hat{star}_{i}=\sum_{W = 1}^{p}\hat{\beta_{W}} X_{i,W}$, where $X_{i,W}$  is the number of times that word W was used by consumer i

Where the OLS estimator $\hat{\beta_{W}^{OLS}}$ solves: 

$argmin_\beta (\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(Y_{i} - X_{i}'\beta)^2)$

```{r include=FALSE}
#11.0 MODELLING 1: [TRAINING DATA] OLS Linear Regression

##11.1 Construct linear regression of "stars" against "features"
linreg_unreg_train <- lm(stars~ ., data=review_train) #create the linear regression

##11.2 Review results and coefficients
summary(linreg_unreg_train)

```

Calculating the mean squared error (MSE), we get $MSE_{OLS}= 1.44264812413296$.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#12.0 MODEL EVALUATION 1 [TEST DATA] OLS Linear Regression

##12.1 Fit model onto test data (exclude first column which is the outcome) to generate predicted value
linreg_unreg_predict <- predict(linreg_unreg_train, newdata=review_test[,-1]) 

##12.2 Calculate empirical Mean Squared Error in the TEST data
linreg_unreg_test_MSE <- mean((linreg_unreg_predict-review_test$stars)^2)

sprintf((linreg_unreg_test_MSE), fmt = '%#.14f')
#Finding: Mean Squared Error = 1.44264812413296 
```

However, cognizant that OLS estimators are unbiased while incurring high variance, we are willing to use Shrinkage methods to incur bias and reduce variance to achieve greater prediction accuracy, so long as the reduction in variance is greater than the increase in bias. 

\newpage

## 4.2) RIDGE REGRESSION 
Preserving the assumption of linearity, we conduct a Ridge regression by imposing a penalisation term on the model, such that $\hat{\beta_{W}^{Ridge}}$ now solves:

$argmin_\beta (\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(Y_{i} - X_{i}'\beta)^2 + \lambda\sum_{W=1}^{p}\beta_{W}^2)$

By penalising excessively large predictors, we reduce the model’s variance by shrinking the estimator coefficients, while retaining the same number of predictors as the OLS.

Using cross-validation, we choose the $\lambda$ that minimises the MSE based on the training dataset, where $\lambda_{Ridge}= 0.03663183779814$. 

```{r include=FALSE}
#13.0 MODELLING 2: [TRAINING DATA] Shrinkage Methods -- Ridge Linear Regression

##13.1 Install required packages
install.packages("glmnet")
library(glmnet)

##13.2 Conduct cross validation to find lambda that minimises empirical Mean Squared Error in training data

###13.2.1
cv.out.ridge <- cv.glmnet(as.matrix(review_train_predictors), as.matrix(review_train_stars), alpha=0, nfolds=10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
###13.2.2 Plot lambda against MSE
plot(cv.out.ridge)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
###13.2.3 Find lambda that minimises empirial MSE in training data set
lambda_ridge_cv <- cv.out.ridge$lambda.min 

sprintf((lambda_ridge_cv), fmt = '%#.14f')
#Estimate = 0.03663183779814
```


Calculating the MSE, we get $MSE_{Ridge}=1.44250610267150$.

```{r echo=FALSE}
##13.3 Estimate Ridge with lambda chosen by Cross Validation
ridge.mod <- glmnet(review_train_predictors, review_train_stars, alpha=0, lambda=lambda_ridge_cv, thresh=1e-12)


#14.0 MODEL EVALUATION 2: [TEST DATA] Shrinkage Methods -- Ridge Linear Regression

##14.1 Fit on test data
ridge.pred <- predict(ridge.mod, s=lambda_ridge_cv, newx=as.matrix(review_test_predictors))
ridge_MSE <- mean((ridge.pred-review_test_stars)^2)

sprintf((ridge_MSE), fmt = '%#.14f')
#Finding: Mean Squared Error = 1.44250610267150 
```

\newpage

## 4.3) LASSO REGRESSION 
Similarly, preserving the assumption of linearity, we conduct a LASSO regression by imposing a penalisation term on the model, such that $\hat{\beta_{W}^{LASSO}}$ now solve:

$argmin_\beta (\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(Y_{i} - X_{i}'\beta)^2 + \lambda\sum_{W=1}^{p}|\beta_{W}|)$

By penalising excessively large predictors, we force the model to reduce its variance by setting some estimator coefficients to 0 or shrinking them.  

Using cross-validation, we choose the $\lambda$ that minimises the MSE based on the training dataset, where $\lambda_{LASSO}= 0.00054397116518$.

```{r include=FALSE}
#15.0 MODELLING 2: [TRAINING DATA] Shrinkage Methods -- LASSO Linear Regression

#15.1 Conduct cross validation to find lambda that minimises empirical Mean Squared Error in training data
cv.out.LASSO <- cv.glmnet(as.matrix(review_train_predictors), as.matrix(review_train_stars), alpha=1, nfolds=10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(cv.out.LASSO)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
###15.1.3 Find lambda that minimises empirial MSE in training data set
lambda_LASSO_cv <- cv.out.LASSO$lambda.min 

sprintf((lambda_LASSO_cv), fmt = '%#.14f')
#Estimate = 0.00054397116518
```


Calculating the MSE, we get $MSE_{LASSO}= 1.44261530919753$.

```{r echo=FALSE}
##15.2 Estimate LASSO with lambda chosen by Cross Validation
LASSO.mod <- glmnet(review_train_predictors, review_train_stars, alpha=1, lambda=lambda_LASSO_cv, thresh=1e-12)


#16.0 MODEL EVALUATION 3: [TEST DATA] Shrinkage Methods -- Ridge Linear Regression

##16.1 Fit on test data
LASSO.pred <- predict(LASSO.mod, s=lambda_LASSO_cv, newx=as.matrix(review_test_predictors))
LASSO_MSE <- mean((LASSO.pred-review_test_stars)^2)

sprintf((LASSO_MSE), fmt = '%#.14f')
#Finding: Mean Squared Error = 1.44261530919753 
```

\newpage

## 4.4) REGRESSION DECISION TREE 
Assuming a non-linear relationship between the frequency of usage for each word and the star-rating, we construct a Regression Decision Tree from the training data, seeking to obtain an interpretable model to predict star-ratings. 

```{r include=FALSE}
#17.0 MODELLING 4: [TRAINING DATA] Regression Decision Tree 

##17.1 Install required packages
install.packages("tree")
library(tree)
install.packages("rpart")
library(rpart)
install.packages("rpart.plot")
library(rpart.plot)
install.packages("tidymodels")
library(tidymodels)


##17.2 Construct tree using rpart package
rpart_tree <- rpart(stars ~ ., data=review_train)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
##17.3 Construct graph
rpart.plot(rpart_tree)
```

We observe that customers who use the words “amazing”, “delicious”, “excellent”, and “awesome” — subject to their constraints — give a star-rating of at least 4.5. 

Calculating the MSE, we get an estimated $MSE_{RegressionDecisionTree}= 2.67815955669566$.


```{r echo=FALSE}
#18.0 MODEL EVALUATION 4: [TEST DATA] Regression Decision Tree

##18.1 Make predictions and add to the test data
regression_tree_prediction <- predict(rpart_tree,new_data=review_test) %>% 
  cbind(review_test)
View(regression_tree_prediction)

##18.2 Evaluating Performance

###18.2.1 Evaluating using mae (Mean Absolute Error)
regression_tree_performance_mae <- mae(regression_tree_prediction, estimate = ".", truth=stars)

View(regression_tree_performance_mae)
#Finding: estimate = 1.354388

###18.2.2 Evaluating using rmse (Root Mean Squared Error)
regression_tree_performance_rmse <- rmse(regression_tree_prediction, estimate = ".", truth=stars)

View(regression_tree_performance_rmse)
#Finding: estimate = 1.636508
regressiontree_MSE <- (regression_tree_performance_rmse$.estimate)^2


sprintf((regressiontree_MSE), fmt = '%#.14f')
#Finding: Mean Squared Error (estimate) = 2.67815955669566 
```

\newpage

# 5)	DISCUSSION & DEPLOYMENT
Comparing the models, we observe that the Ridge Regression has the lowest MSE. Assessing that it is unfeasible to reduce MSE to 0 due to the presence of irreducible errors from the world’s natural randomness, we conclude that the Ridge is the most accurate model for out-of-sample predictions of consumer i’s star-ratings on business j. 

| Model | MSE |
|:-----:|:-----:|
|OLS| 1.44264812413296|
|Ridge| 1.44250610267150|
|LASSO| 1.44261530919753|
|Regression Decision Tree| 2.67815955669566|

The Ridge has the advantage of being intuitive and simple to use for businesses. Notably, businesses can observe estimator coefficients and identify words like “delicious” (8th largest estimator coefficient in absolute terms) that increase predicted star-ratings, consequently improving areas that customers prioritise to maximise star-ratings. Additionally, according to other research, the Ridge’s assumption of linearity between star-ratings and reviews likely holds (Dong et al., 2020, p. 4). 

```{r include=FALSE}
#19.0 Obtain coefficients of Ridge

##19.1 Extract coefficients from Ridge model (exclude intercept which is in column 1)
Ridge_coefficients <- coef(ridge.mod)[-1]

##19.2 Extract feature names from Ridge model (obtained from review_train_predictors)
Ridge_features <- colnames(as.matrix(review_train_predictors))

##19.3 Combine coefficients and feature names
Ridge_overview <- data.frame(Coefficient = as.matrix(Ridge_coefficients), Feature_Name = Ridge_features)

##19.4 Add a column for absolute coefficient magnitude
Ridge_overview <- Ridge_overview %>%
  mutate(Coefficient_Magnitude = abs(Coefficient))

##19.5 Sort the data frame by coefficient magnitude in descending order
Ridge_overview <- Ridge_overview %>%
  arrange(desc(Coefficient_Magnitude))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
##19.6 Display top 15 rows
head(Ridge_overview, 15)
```


However, a limitation is that the Ridge does not eliminate irrelevant predictors. Nonetheless, the small value of $\lambda_{Ridge}$ (0.03663183779814) likely implies that most predictors used were relevant. Additionally, this model assumes that words are not overly used such that the predicted output exceeds the [1,5] boundary.

\newpage

# 6) CHALLENGES
The most difficult challenge encountered was the processing of huge volumes of data. Recognising that the original dataset contained over 7 million observations, the machine used had insufficient memory to conduct analysis, taking over 12 hours to run commands such as creating DFMs. Therefore, we circumvented this by creating a smaller-sized random sample and removing unused data frames to save machine memory.

# 7) CONCLUSION 
This research conducted textual analysis and concluded that the Ridge Regression generates the most accurate prediction of consumer i’s star-ratings for business j. Future research could consider adopting more complex non-linear models — such as bagging — to assess whether they are more useful compared to linear models in prediction.
